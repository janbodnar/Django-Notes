# Instructions

At the beginning, provide a detailed, in-depth description of the topic covered. 

## Code Descriptions

When asked to add a description:  

- Include a brief summary directly below the section title
- Follow with a detailed explanation beneath the code block, at least 2-3 sentences,
  more for more complex examples.   
- Limit text to **80 characters per line**, ending each line with **two spaces**  
- Maintain consistency with existing documents in the repository  

##  Example Structure

Examples should build progressivelyâ€”from simple to advanced concepts.  
Avoid numbering section titles (e.g. *Example 1: Basic types*).  
Use plain titles like *Basic types*.

Use a **dark theme** for all code blocks.  


## Terminology

When referencing functions or methods:  

- Use names without parentheses (e.g. *the `main` function*, not *`main()`*)  
- Be precise and consistent in terminology across examples
